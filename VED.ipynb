Tc-99m-labeled diphosphonates have been used for bone scanning as a major diagnostic tool since the beginning of 1970s (2). Tc-99m MDP has rapid blood clearance, excellent in vivo chemical stability, and a high bone-to-soft tissue ratio, thus, it is ideal for bone imaging (3). In the literature, many cases of incidental Tc-99m-MDP uptake by the soft tissue have been reported due to various reasons, both benign (tumoral calcinosis, myositis ossificans) and malignant (sarcomas, adenocarcinomas, metastases) conditions (4,5). Mechanisms leading to increased extraosseous Tc-99m MDP uptake include extracellular fluid expansion, enhanced local vascularity and permeability, and high tissue calcium\n",
